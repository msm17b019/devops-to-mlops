# 📌 Why I’m Learning the Basics First

When I first started my MLOps journey, I jumped straight into the **"Fundamentals of MLOps"** course by KodeKloud.  

After a few videos, I realized something important:  
> Without a good grasp of basic Machine Learning concepts, I was struggling to connect the dots.

It wasn’t that the course was bad — it’s well-structured — but my foundation was missing.  
I decided to pause and **go back to the basics**:
- What is Machine Learning?  
- Different types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning)  
- Key concepts like features, labels, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score  
- The typical ML workflow  
- Essential Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

Now, I’m building a **solid foundation** so that when I return to the course:
- The concepts will make more sense  
- I’ll be able to follow along without constant “what does that mean?” moments  
- I’ll feel more confident applying MLOps tools and best practices  

**Takeaway:** Sometimes slowing down is the fastest way forward.
