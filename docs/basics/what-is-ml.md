# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn from examples instead of giving them step-by-step instructions.

Instead of programming a computer to follow fixed rules, you give it lots of data and let it find patterns by itself. Then, it can use those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

Example:

If you want a computer to recognize cats in photos, you don't write "if it has pointy ears and whiskers, it's a cat."

Instead, you show it thousands of pictures labeled "cat" or "not cat".

Over time, the computer figures out what makes a "cat" and can guess correctly for new photos it has not seen before.

It's kind of like how you learned to tell apples from oranges - by seeing many examples, not by memorizing a rule book.
