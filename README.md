# DevOps to MLOps Journey

This repository documents my personal journey of transitioning from **DevOps** to **MLOps** — covering concepts, tools, projects, and the lessons (and failures) along the way.

The goal:  
- Build a strong MLOps foundation.
- Apply my DevOps experience to machine learning workflows.
- Share my learning openly for others making the same transition.
